# Governance Model – AIC-Energy

## 1. Purpose of Governance

AIC-Energy operates under the belief that **technical power without governance inevitably drifts toward abuse**.

This governance model exists to:
- Prevent concentration of control
- Preserve ethical intent over time
- Enable responsible evolution
- Protect the project from capture by political, military, or purely commercial interests

Governance is treated as a **system component**, not an administrative afterthought.

---

## 2. Governance Principles

All governance decisions are guided by the following principles:

1. **Human-first alignment**  
   Energy systems exist to serve human well-being and ecological balance.

2. **Decentralization of authority**  
   No single individual or entity should be able to unilaterally redirect the project.

3. **Transparency with accountability**  
   Decisions should be explainable and auditable.

4. **Reversibility**  
   Major decisions must be undoable where technically and socially possible.

5. **Resistance to capture**  
   The project must actively resist coercion, funding pressure, or narrative hijacking.

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

### Maintainers
Maintainers are responsible for:
- Reviewing and merging contributions
- Enforcing ethical and security boundaries
- Interpreting project principles in ambiguous cases
- Acting as stewards, not owners

Maintainers **do not** possess absolute authority.

---

### Contributors
Contributors:
- Propose changes via documented PRs
- Participate in design discussions in good faith
- Flag ethical, security, or systemic risks

Influence is earned through **clarity, consistency, and integrity**, not volume or status.

---

### Community Observers
Non-code contributors may:
- Provide ethical critique
- Review governance decisions
- Raise long-term risk concerns

Their role is advisory but valued.

---

## 4. Decision-Making Process

Decisions fall into three categories:

### 4.1 Routine Decisions
- Minor fixes
- Documentation updates
- Non-controversial refactors  
→ Decided by maintainers through normal review.

---

### 4.2 Structural Decisions
- Architecture changes
- Energy coordination logic
- Governance or security model updates  
→ Require:
- Written rationale
- Open review period
- Explicit approval by multiple maintainers

---

### 4.3 Existential Decisions
- Licensing changes
- Directional pivot
- External institutional alignment  
→ Require:
- Public proposal
- Ethical impact assessment
- Extended review and dissent consideration

Silence does not imply consent.

---

## 5. Conflict Resolution

When conflicts arise:
1. Slow down the decision
2. Separate technical facts from value judgments
3. Document dissent clearly
4. Prefer containment over forced consensus

Unresolved disagreement is acceptable.  
Forced alignment is not.

---

## 6. Governance Drift & Review

Governance itself is subject to review.

Indicators of unhealthy drift include:
- Power centralization
- Speed prioritized over safety
- Suppression of ethical critique
- Alignment with coercive institutions

Periodic reflection is encouraged, even if uncomfortable.

---

## 7. Final Authority

No document, role, or individual is above the core principles of AIC.

If governance contradicts those principles, governance must change.

This project chooses **continuity of values over continuity of control**.
