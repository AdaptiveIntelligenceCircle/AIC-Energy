# Contributing to AIC-Energy

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **AIC-Energy**.

AIC-Energy is part of the Adaptive Intelligence Circle (AIC) ecosystem, focusing on ethical, decentralized, and human-aligned energy intelligence systems.  
Contributions are welcome, but **must respect the philosophical and technical principles of the project**.

---

## 1. Guiding Principles

Before contributing, please understand that AIC-Energy is built on:

- Human-centric intelligence (HMN-aligned)
- Non-extractive, non-exploitative design
- Long-term sustainability over short-term optimization
- Transparency, accountability, and reversibility
- Resistance to weaponization, coercion, or authoritarian misuse

If your contribution conflicts with these principles, it will not be accepted.

## 2. What You Can Contribute

We welcome contributions in the following areas:

- Core architecture & system design
- Energy intelligence models (simulation, optimization, forecasting)
- Decentralized coordination logic
- Security, safety, and resilience mechanisms
- Documentation, diagrams, and research notes
- Ethical analysis, governance models, and failure scenarios

---

## 3. Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository
2. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

3. Make changes with clear, minimal, and explainable commits

4. Add documentation where applicable

5. Submit a Pull Request (PR) with:

+ Motivation

+ Design explanation

+ Potential risks or ethical concerns

## 4. Coding Standards

+ Prefer clarity over cleverness

+ Explicit is better than implicit

+ Avoid unnecessary abstractions

+ Every adaptive mechanism must be explainable

+ Security-sensitive code must include threat reasoning

+ If code cannot be reasonably audited or understood, it will be rejected.

## 5. Review Process

All contributions are reviewed with respect to:

+ Technical correctness

+ Systemic impact

+ Ethical alignment

+ Long-term maintainability

+ Potential misuse vectors

Reviews may take time. This is intentional.

## 6. Communication

- Be respectful and precise

- Argue ideas, not people

- Assume good faith, but verify logic

- Emotional manipulation, hype, or authority-based arguments are discouraged

## 7. License & Attribution

By contributing, you agree that your work will be licensed under the same license as this repository and may be used for non-commercial, humanitarian, or research-oriented purposes consistent with AIC principles.
