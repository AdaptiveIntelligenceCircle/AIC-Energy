# Ethical Use Policy – AIC-Energy

## 1. Purpose

AIC-Energy is designed to explore and support **ethical, decentralized, and human-aligned energy intelligence**.

This policy defines **how the system may and may not be used**, regardless of legal permissibility.

Legality is a minimum requirement.  
Ethical alignment is the standard.

---

## 2. Permitted Use

AIC-Energy may be used for:

- Research and education
- Sustainable energy coordination
- Simulation of decentralized energy systems
- Community-scale energy resilience
- Transparency-oriented governance experiments
- Human-in-the-loop decision support

Use cases must respect:
- Human dignity
- Ecological limits
- Informed consent where applicable

---

## 3. Prohibited Use

AIC-Energy must NOT be used for:

- Mass surveillance or behavioral monitoring
- Military, paramilitary, or offensive cyber operations
- Energy-based political coercion
- Authoritarian control or population manipulation
- Exploitative extraction of human or environmental resources
- Fully autonomous decision-making without human override in critical contexts

Any attempt to adapt the system for these purposes violates this policy.

---

## 4. Dual-Use Awareness

Some technologies are inherently dual-use.

In such cases:
- The **burden of justification** lies with the user
- Mitigation strategies must be explicit
- Human oversight must be preserved
- Reversibility must be demonstrated

“Neutral tooling” is not accepted as a justification.

---

## 5. Human Oversight Requirement

Critical decisions involving:
- Energy allocation
- System shutdowns
- Emergency responses

must include:
- Human-in-the-loop mechanisms
- Clear audit trails
- Defined escalation paths

Full automation without accountability is prohibited.

---

## 6. Responsibility of Users

Users are responsible for:
- Understanding system limits
- Avoiding misuse through omission or negligence
- Preventing downstream abuse where reasonably foreseeable

“I did not intend harm” is insufficient if harm was predictable.

---

## 7. Enforcement

Violations may result in:
- Revocation of access
- Public disassociation
- Refusal of future collaboration

The project reserves the right to distance itself from unethical deployments.

---

## 8. Ethical Evolution

Ethics are not static.

This policy may evolve as:
- New risks emerge
- New societal contexts arise
- Better safeguards are discovered

Changes should increase protection, not convenience.

---

## Final Statement

AIC-Energy exists to **expand human choice, not replace it**.

Any use that diminishes human agency, dignity, or future freedom is incompatible with this project.
