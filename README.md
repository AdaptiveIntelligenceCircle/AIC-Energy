**AIC-Energy** is a research-driven, human-aligned energy intelligence framework within the **Adaptive Intelligence Circle (AIC)** ecosystem.

This project explores how energy systems can be designed to be:
- Ethically grounded
- Decentralized by default
- Resistant to capture and coercion
- Transparent about failure
- Governed as socio-technical systems, not just infrastructure

AIC-Energy is not a product.
It is not an optimization race.
It is an experiment in *how power should behave*.

## Why AIC-Energy Exists

Modern energy systems suffer from three systemic problems:

1. **Over-centralization**  
2. **Opacity disguised as efficiency**  
3. **Optimization without moral boundaries**

Most energy intelligence projects focus on:
> accuracy, profit, scale, control

AIC-Energy focuses on:
> responsibility, reversibility, governance, and human agency

The goal is not to build a “smarter grid”,  
but a **more accountable one**.

## Core Principles

AIC-Energy is built around the following non-negotiable principles:

- **Human-in-the-loop by design**  
  Critical decisions must remain accountable to humans.

- **Bounded intelligence**  
  The system must know and expose its own limits.

- **Decentralized coordination**  
  Local autonomy is preferred over global control.

- **Failure-aware architecture**  
  Failure is documented, anticipated, and designed for.

- **Ethical constraints as system constraints**  
  Ethics are not policy — they are part of the architecture.

## What This Project Is (and Is Not)

### This project IS:
- A research and architectural framework
- A testbed for ethical energy intelligence
- A governance-aware system design
- A long-term experiment in socio-technical alignment

### This project is NOT:
- A commercial energy platform
- A surveillance or monitoring tool
- A military or coercive system
- A “black-box AI” solution
- A promise of optimal outcomes

## Governance & Ethics First

AIC-Energy treats governance as a technical concern, not a legal afterthought.

+ Key documents:

**GOVERNANCE.md** – how decisions are made

**ETHICAL_USE_POLICY.md** – where the system must not be used

**FAILURE_MODES.md** – how and where the system can break

**SECURITY.md** – bounded trust and threat assumptions

If these documents are ignored, the system has already failed.

## Contribution Philosophy

Contributions are welcome — with conditions.

We value:

- Clarity over cleverness

- Explainability over performance

- Ethical reasoning over optimization hype

- Long-term impact over short-term wins

Every contribution is evaluated not only for correctness, but for systemic and ethical impact.

See **CONTRIBUTING.md** for details.

## Security Posture

AIC-Energy assumes:

- Partial compromise is inevitable

- Misuse pressure will increase with success

- Adaptive systems can drift silently

Security is therefore treated as:

- Containment, auditability, and reversibility
not absolute prevention.

See **SECURITY.md**.

## Status

AIC-Energy is experimental.

Expect:

- Incomplete modules

- Design revisions

- Explicit uncertainty

- Slow, deliberate progress

This is intentional.

## Final Note

AIC-Energy does not aim to dominate energy systems.

It aims to prove that intelligence with power can remain accountable.

If the system ever becomes efficient at the cost of human agency, it should be slowed down — or shut down.

That choice is part of the design.
