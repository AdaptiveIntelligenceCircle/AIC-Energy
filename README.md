**AIC-Energy** is a research-driven, human-aligned energy intelligence framework within the **Adaptive Intelligence Circle (AIC)** ecosystem.

This project explores how energy systems can be designed to be:
- Ethically grounded
- Decentralized by default
- Resistant to capture and coercion
- Transparent about failure
- Governed as socio-technical systems, not just infrastructure

AIC-Energy is not a product.
It is not an optimization race.
It is an experiment in *how power should behave*.

## Why AIC-Energy Exists

Modern energy systems suffer from three systemic problems:

1. **Over-centralization**  
2. **Opacity disguised as efficiency**  
3. **Optimization without moral boundaries**

Most energy intelligence projects focus on:
> accuracy, profit, scale, control

AIC-Energy focuses on:
> responsibility, reversibility, governance, and human agency

The goal is not to build a “smarter grid”,  
but a **more accountable one**.

## Core Principles

AIC-Energy is built around the following non-negotiable principles:

- **Human-in-the-loop by design**  
  Critical decisions must remain accountable to humans.

- **Bounded intelligence**  
  The system must know and expose its own limits.

- **Decentralized coordination**  
  Local autonomy is preferred over global control.

- **Failure-aware architecture**  
  Failure is documented, anticipated, and designed for.

- **Ethical constraints as system constraints**  
  Ethics are not policy — they are part of the architecture.

## What This Project Is (and Is Not)

### This project IS:
- A research and architectural framework
- A testbed for ethical energy intelligence
- A governance-aware system design
- A long-term experiment in socio-technical alignment

### This project is NOT:
- A commercial energy platform
- A surveillance or monitoring tool
- A military or coercive system
- A “black-box AI” solution
- A promise of optimal outcomes
